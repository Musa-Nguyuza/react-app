This includes if there are any endorsements as set out in the Policy Schedule, annual increases in your premiums, benefits and/or where you request changes to your policy. SBIB will debit the Collection Amount on xxxx_ day and thereafter on the _____xxx day of every [month, year], or on another day when you have funds in your Bank Account. The Collection Amount will carry a STATEMENT REFERENCE NUMBER which is SBIB’s short name plus your policy number (mention FUN/TMA Policy number).

If the Collection Date falls on a non-processing day (Sunday or public holiday), you agree that the Collection Amount may be debited against the Bank Account on the first business day prior/before. If there is not enough money in your Bank Account on the Collection Date, SBIB will track the Bank Account (at no cost to you) and debit the Collection Amount on another day when there is money in your Bank Account.
