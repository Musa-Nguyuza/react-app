Do you authorise SBIB to debit the [R [xxx amount payable] under the policy agreement from your bank account? If applicable, the first Collection Amount may include additional fees or charges. The Collection Amount may change depending on what is set out in the policy. This includes if there are any endorsements as set out in the Policy Schedule, annual increases in benefits and/or where you request changes to your policy. SBIB will debit the Collection Amount on xxxx_ day and thereafter on the xxxx_ day of every MONTHLY, or on another day when there is money in your Bank Account. The Collection Amount will carry a Statement Reference Number which is SBIB’s short name plus your policy number. This will be provided to you before the first Collection Date. This will help you to identify the Collection Amount on your bank statement. If the Collection Date falls on a non-processing day (Sunday or public holiday), you agree that the Collection Amount may be debited against the Bank Account on the first business day before/prior. If there is not enough money in your Bank Account on the Collection Date, SBIB may track the Bank Account (at no cost to you) and debit the Collection Amount on another day when there is money in your Bank Account. Where the debit of the Collection Amount is successful on more than two consecutive occasions on a date other than your selected date, your Collection Date may default to the successful date. If SBIB cannot debit the Collection Amount for any reason, you understand that your insurance cover may be impacted, and that you may pay for bank charges related to this Debit Order Mandate. The total amount that is collected under this Debit Order Mandate may not be more than the Maximum Payment amount. The annual adjustment rate will not be more than half the premium payment. The Collection Amount will continue to be debited from your Bank Account under this Debit Order Mandate until you cancel; or the Insurer cancels your Policy or until you cancel this Debit Order Mandate by giving us (SBIB) 30 days written notice. You understand that if you cancel the authority to debit your bank account, your insurance policy will be cancelled, and all benefits will cease. If the authentication is not received for some reason, then SBIB will attempt to electronically collect the premium to ensure you remain under cover. Do you confirm that you understand and agree to the terms of this Debit Order Mandate?",
